# Image-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-using-CNN
This project aims to build a Deep Learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either Cat or Dog.  CNN is one of the most effective architectures for image recognition tasks as it automatically extracts relevant features from images and performs classification.
